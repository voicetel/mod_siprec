 * siprec_invite.h — SRC-side SIP INVITE / re-INVITE / BYE
 * dispatched to a Session Recording Server.

 * Implementation strategy: use FreeSWITCH's existing sofia
 * profile (the same one carrying the original call) to send
 * the recording-leg INVITE. This avoids a second SIP stack in
 * the same process and keeps SIP transport policy (NAT
 * handling, TLS, source IP) consistent with the original leg.
 *
 * The recording leg is a NEW SIP dialog with its own Call-ID,
 * From-tag, To-tag, CSeq sequence — RFC 7866 §6.1.

 *   sofia_profile      — the FS sofia profile to use as

 *                       channel's `sofia_profile_name`
 *                       variable; never hardcoded.
 *   srs_uri            — SIP URI of the SRS, e.g.
 *                       "sip:srs@127.0.0.1:5070"
 *   sdp_body           — pre-built SDP from siprec_sdp_build

 *                       siprec_metadata_build
 *
 * Returns SWITCH_STATUS_SUCCESS on dispatch (the actual
 * 200 OK arrives async — caller polls recording->state or
 * registers a callback). Failure means dispatch couldn't
 * begin — TLS handshake error, originate budget exhausted,
 * profile not loaded.
 *
 * The recording-leg call is dispatched as a sofia originate
 * with the metadata XML attached via the documented FS
 * `sip_multipart` channel variable (see process_mp() in
 * sofia_media.c). mod_sofia auto-generates the SDP for the
 * outbound leg and combines it with our metadata into the
 * multipart/mixed body.
 *
 * sdp_body argument is reserved for v1.1 (strict-RFC SDP
 * override with explicit a=label per stream) — v1 leaves it
 * NULL and lets sofia generate the SDP.
