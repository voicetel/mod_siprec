 * siprec_invite.h — SRC-side SIP INVITE / re-INVITE / BYE

 * profile (the same one carrying the original call) to send
 * the recording-leg INVITE. This avoids a second SIP stack in
 * the same process and keeps SIP transport policy (NAT
 * handling, TLS, source IP) consistent with the original leg.
 *
 * The recording leg is a NEW SIP dialog with its own Call-ID,
 * From-tag, To-tag, CSeq sequence — RFC 7866 §6.1.

 *

 * with the metadata XML attached via the documented FS
 * `sip_multipart` channel variable (see process_mp() in
