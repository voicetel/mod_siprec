 * the local SDP after originate succeeds and re-INVITE the
 * SRS with the labelled body. Same low-risk modification
 * pattern as flip_direction: ports, codec, c=, crypto stay
 * untouched; we only add one attribute line per m= block.
 *
 * The label is placed immediately before the direction
 * attribute (a=sendonly / a=inactive) within each m= block,
 * or at the end of the block if no direction attribute is
 * present. m= blocks that already carry a=label:<anything>
 * are left untouched (idempotent — calling this on an
 * already-labelled SDP is safe).
 *
 * Multi-stream limitation: in v1 every m= block gets the
 * SAME label string. mod_sofia's auto-gen produces a single
 * m=audio so this is a single-stream injection in practice;
 * full per-stream labelling per RFC 7866 §7.5 needs the
 * "set local SDP before originate" path.
